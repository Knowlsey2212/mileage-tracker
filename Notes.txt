Where did i get too last time?

Login's now work, users can manually reset passwords if they like, brilliant

Next steps:

- Entries are being saved in gernal, we now want them to be
    saved based off the user that is signed in

- Add mileage to each school so calculations can now acurtually take place

- Add Week and mon selector and Dates as currently it is just the same week

- Make it so it opens on the most recent working week
